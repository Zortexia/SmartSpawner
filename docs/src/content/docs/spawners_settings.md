title: Spawner Settings Configuration
description: Configure spawner appearance, loot drops, and experience values for resource generation.
---

SmartSpawner allows you to create spawners that generate resources without spawning mobs. Configure item spawner appearance, drops, and experience through the `spawners_settings.yml` file.

:::note[Important: Drop Multiplier]
Each time a spawner is triggered, it will generate between **min_mobs** and **max_mobs** (default: 1 to 4) times the drops specified below. This means the actual drops can be significantly higher than the base amounts configured.
:::

:::caution[Current Limitations]
Smart spawners currently **do not support** potions and enchanted books. Only **tipped arrows** are supported with potion effects.
:::

## Configuration Format

```yaml
# Global default for unknown mobs
default_material: "SPAWNER"

MOB_NAME:
  experience: <number>
  drop_chance: <percentage>  # Optional, defaults to 100.0 when omitted
  head_texture:
    material: <MATERIAL>
    custom_texture: <texture_hash>  # null for vanilla heads
  loot:  # Optional section
    ITEM_ID:
      amount: <min>-<max>
      chance: <percentage>
      # Optional properties
      durability: <min>-<max>
      potion_type: <POTION_TYPE>  # For tipped arrows
```

## Core Properties

### Spawner Properties

| Property | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **default_material** | `"SPAWNER"` | Fallback material for unknown mobs (global) |
| **experience** | `5` | XP generated per spawner trigger |
| **drop_chance** | `75.0` | Optional chance for the Smart Spawner item to drop when the spawner is broken. Omitted entities default to `100.0` |
| **material** | `"PLAYER_HEAD"` | Head texture material (PLAYER_HEAD, SPAWNER, etc.) |
| **custom_texture** | `"abc123..."` | Base64 texture hash (use `null` for vanilla heads) |

### Loot Properties

| Property | Format | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **amount** | `1-3` | Quantity range of items generated |
| **chance** | `50.0` | Drop probability (0.0-100.0) |
| **durability** | `1-384` | Durability range for tools/weapons |
| **potion_type** | `POISON` | Potion type for tipped arrows |

### Validation Rules
- Experience must be non-negative number
- Amount format: `min-max` where min ≤ max
- Chance between 0.0-100.0
- Spawner `drop_chance` must be between 0.0-100.0
- Custom texture can be `null` for vanilla mob heads

## Spawner Break Drop Chance

`drop_chance` controls whether a Smart Spawner item is returned when that Smart Spawner block is broken. This is separate from loot item `chance`, which controls generated mob drops.

If `drop_chance` is omitted for an entity, SmartSpawner uses `100.0`, so the spawner item always drops. The default `spawners_settings.yml` does not enable a drop chance value by default; it only includes a commented example under `ALLAY`.

When `sneak_break` is enabled and an entity has `drop_chance` configured, players cannot use sneak breaking to remove a whole Smart Spawner stack for that entity. They must break one spawner at a time so each drop chance roll remains clear and controlled.

Players with `smartspawner.break.bypassdropchance` bypass this chance entirely: they always receive spawner drops, can sneak break stacks, and can open the stacker GUI for spawners with `drop_chance`.

```yaml
ALLAY:
  experience: 0
  # Optional spawner item drop chance when this Smart Spawner is broken.
  # If this key is omitted, the spawner item drop chance defaults to 100.0.
  # Values must be percentages from 0.0 to 100.0.
  # drop_chance: 100.0
  head_texture:
    material: "PLAYER_HEAD"
    custom_texture: "df5de940bfe499c59ee8dac9f9c3919e7535eff3a9acb16f4842bf290f4c679f"
```

## Understanding Drop Mechanics

### Base Drops vs Actual Drops
The `amount` value in the configuration is the **base amount** per spawner cycle. The actual amount generated is:

```
Actual Drops = Base Amount × Random(min_mobs, max_mobs)
```

For example, if `min_mobs=1` and `max_mobs=4` (defaults):
- Base amount `1-1` → Actual drops: `1-4` items
- Base amount `2-3` → Actual drops: `2-12` items
- Base amount `1-2` → Actual drops: `1-8` items

### Multiple Loot Entries
Each loot entry is rolled independently:
1. Check if the drop occurs (based on `chance`)
2. Determine base amount (within `amount` range)
3. Multiply by spawner trigger count (min_mobs to max_mobs)

This means a spawner can generate multiple different items from a single trigger.

## Supported Types

### Common Entities
**Full List:** [Paper Entity Documentation](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/org/bukkit/entity/Entity.html)

### Common Materials
**Full List:** [Paper Material Documentation](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/org/bukkit/Material.html)

### Potion Types (for Tipped Arrows)
**Full List:** [Paper PotionType Documentation](https://jd.papermc.io/paper/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html)

<br>

Potion types use predefined names from the Paper API. Common formats include:

- **Basic**: Standard effect duration and potency
- **Extended**: Same potency but longer duration
- **Strong**: Higher potency but standard duration

Examples:
- `POISON`: Causes damage over time (0:45 duration, 1 damage/second)
- `LONG_POISON`: Extended poison effect (2:15 duration, 1 damage/second)
- `STRONG_POISON`: Stronger poison (0:22 duration, 2 damage/second)

## Default Configuration

SmartSpawner includes comprehensive defaults based on Minecraft Wiki data, including custom head textures for all mobs.

- **View Online:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NighterDevelopment/smartspawner/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/spawners_settings.yml)
- **Auto-Regenerate:** Delete `spawners_settings.yml` and restart server

## Head Texture Notes

### Obtaining Custom Textures
Custom player head textures can be obtained from:
- [Minecraft-Heads.com](https://minecraft-heads.com/)
- [MCHeads.net](https://mc-heads.net/)
- [MCHeads.ru](https://mcheads.ru/en)
- Extract from existing player heads using `/give` commands

### Vanilla Head Materials
Some mobs use vanilla Minecraft head materials:
- `SKELETON_SKULL` - Regular skeleton
- `WITHER_SKELETON_SKULL` - Wither skeleton
- `ZOMBIE_HEAD` - Zombie
*Last update: November 8, 2025*
- `PIGLIN_HEAD` - Piglin/Piglin Brute
- `DRAGON_HEAD` - Ender dragon

When using vanilla heads, set `custom_texture: null`.

## Command Usage

To give smart spawners to players, use:

```bash
/ss give spawner <player> <item_type> [amount]
```

**Example:**
```bash
/ss give spawner @p skeleton 1
/ss give spawner Player123 wither_skeleton 3
```
